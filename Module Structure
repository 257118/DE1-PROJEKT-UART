Module Structure:

* ascii_input
This module is designed for entering a single ASCII character using switches (sw[7:0]) and confirming the input with a button (BTNC). After pressing the button, the character is saved and a ready signal is generated, which informs the rest of the system (e.g., a UART transmitter) that the character is ready to be sent.
