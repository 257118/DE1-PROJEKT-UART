Module Structure:

* top_level (Top Module)
The main module that connects all other modules. It handles routing of signals between the boardâ€™s inputs/outputs and the internal logic blocks.

* mode_control
This module is responsible for switching between Tx/Rx modes when the BTNU button is pressed.

* baud_rate_control
This module switches the baud rate between 4800 and 9600 when the BTNL button is pressed. The output of this module is used as a parameter for the UART.

* input_buffer
A buffer that receives data from the switches and stores the current bit set. The BTNC button sends the data for processing.

* ascii_decoder
This module converts an 8-bit input (from the switches or buffer) to an ASCII symbol, which is then displayed on the 7-segment display.

* seven_segment_display
Responsible for displaying the current symbol on the display.

* uart_tx
The UART transmission module. It is activated by the BTNR (SEND) button and sends the symbol selected by the user.

* uart_rx
The UART reception module. In Rx mode, it receives data and sends it to the seven_segment_display.

* reset_controller
Monitors the BTND (RESET) button and resets mode_control, baud_rate_control, input_buffer, and others.
